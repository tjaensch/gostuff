","NCEI's partnership with all NOAA line offices and academia enables the long-term preservation of publicly funded data.

Through national commitment SAMOS Creates quality estimates of the heat, moisture, momentum, and radiation fluxes at the air-sea interface; Improves our understanding of the biases and uncertainties in global air-sea fluxes; Benchmarks new satellite and model products; And provides high quality observations to support modeling activities (e.g., reanalysis) and global climate programs.

SAMOS plans to improve access to quality assured SAMOS data for scientific and operational users by providing free and open access to data and metadata; Expand availability of SAMOS observations collected in remote ocean regions (e.g., Southern Ocean); Improve the accuracy and calibration of SAMOS measurements; Provide standards for data and metadata collected on SAMOS equipped vessel; Ensure routine archival of SAMOS data at world data centers; Develop documentation and training materials for use by data collectors and the user community; Support comparison studies between in-situ platforms (e.g., R/Vs, VOS, buoys); And develop partnerships in the international marine community.
