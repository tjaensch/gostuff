It provides a consistent, daily and monthly time series of sea ice concentrations from 09 July 1987 through the most recent processing for both the north and south polar regions on a 25 km x 25 km polar stereographic grid.

The NOAA/NSIDC CDR is based on the recommendations from the National Research Council (NRC) (2004). It is produced from gridded brightness temperatures from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F8, F11, and F13 Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave radiometers and the DMSP F17 Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) passive microwave radiometer.

Variables containing standard deviation, quality flags, and projection information are also included in the netCDF files. Data are available via FTP."

These empirically-derived algorithms apply a small correction for the cool-skin effect depending on surface wind speed, and filter out SST values suspected to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface wind speeds of below 6 ms-1 during the day and less than 2 ms-1 during the night."

A second similar product is available back to 1981 that includes only in situ and AVHRR Pathfinder data in its analysis. The OI analysis is a daily average SST that is bias adjusted using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average and is thus tuned to about 0.3 meter.

The input data for the NOAA AMSU BT consists of the raw counts data of the earth and blackbody views saved in the operational level-b files available from the NCEI Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) library. Application of inter-satellite calibration for the raw counts data using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) Integrated Microwave Inter-calibration Approach (IMICA) provides the final consistent brightness temperature fundamental climate data record; NOAA/STAR IMICA accounts for calibration of non-linearity and artificial instrumental drifts."

The total, spectrally integrated energy input to the top of the Earth's atmosphere, at a standard distance of one Astronomical Unit from the Sun defines TSI (Wm-2). The data record utilizes solar irradiance models that determine the changes with respect to quiet Sun conditions when facular brightening and sunspot darkening features are present on the solar disk, where the magnitude of the changes in irradiance are determined from linear regression of the proxy Mg II index and sunspot area indices against the approximately decade-long solar irradiance measurements of the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)."

NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous."

It provides a daily cloud-free field of foundation sea surface temperature at approximately 2 km resolution (0.02 degree) for the North-Western European shelves. It is generated by merging microwave and infrared satellite sea surface temperature observations including those from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager. The satellite SST observations are intercalibrated using the AATSR sensor as a reference (previously re-calibrated using all available in situ data). The development of the global real-time sea surface temperature at Ifremer/CERSAT is supported by European Commission initially in the frame of MERSEA project."

The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on several NOAA satellites, and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes.

REMO uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites series (NOAA 15, NOAA 16, NOAA 17, NOAA 18 and NOAA 19) and Microwave Imager (TMI) data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) which is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to generate 0.05 degree daily cloud free blended (infrared and microwave) SST products (approximately 5.5 km). The data lies between latitudes 45 S and 15 N and longitudes 70 W and 15 W region and are fully validated by in situ measurements from eleven buoys of Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA).AVHRR is a scanning radiometer capable of detecting energy from land, ocean and atmosphere. It operates with six spectral bands arranged in the regions of visible and infrared region. TRMM was launched in December, 1997, having an orbital inclination of 53 degree and altitude 350 km, an equatorial orbit that ranges from 40 N to 40 S and a spatial resolution of 0.25 degree (&#8764;27.75 km). Although infrared AVHRR SST data have high spatial resolution, they are contaminated by cloud cover and aerosols, while lower resolution microvwave TMI data are barely influenced by these."

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. This particular dataset is derived from Global Area Coverage (GAC) binary AVHRR SST binary data originally produced by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) and downloaded from the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage recorded on tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station. Finally, L2P data products are derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES)."

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. This particular dataset is derived from Global Area Coverage (GAC) binary AVHRR SST binary data originally produced by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) and downloaded from the JPL Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage recorded on tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station. Finally, L2P data products are derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES)."

This Research to Operations (RTO) analysis is based upon a composite of either nighttime or daytime GHRSST L2P skin SST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, and subskin SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE). Four unique products (composites) are created: MODIS Terra/AMSRE day and night, and MODIS Aqua/AMSRE day and night. This particular dataset represents a MODIS Terra and AMSRE composite using nighttime data. The algorithm is based on a weighting scheme and compositing wherby MODIS data are used if they exist to preserve the highest resolution possible. The product is categorized as blended because no attempt is made to correct for foundation or skin temperature."

GOES 13 imager level 1 data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system.
SST is retrieved from the GOES 13 infrared channels (3.9 and 10.8 micrometer) using a multispectral algorithm. Due to the lack of 12 micrometer channel in the GOES 13 imager, SST retrieval is not possible in daytime conditions. Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiatiave transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions. Every 30 minutes slot is processed at full satellite resolution. The operational products are then produced by remapping over a 0.05 degree regular grid (60S-60N and 135W-15W) SST fields obtained by aggregating 30 minute SST data available in one hour time, and the priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour.

NOAA is responsible for all JPSS products, including SST from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard of 112.56 degrees using 16 detectors and a double-sided mirror assembly. At a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily coverage both on the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands). The L2P SST product is derived at the native sensor resolution (~0.75 km at nadir, ~1.5 km at swath edge) using NOAA's Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system. In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns), and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns) bands. The reflectances are used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are 10min granules in netcdf4 format, compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). There are 144 granules per 24hr interval, with a total data volume of 27GB/day. Fill values are reported at all invalid pixels, including pixels at >5 km inland. For each valid water pixel (defined as ocean, sea, lake or river, and up to 5 km inland), the following layers are reported: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (included for those users interested in direct ""radiance assimilation"", e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using Multi-Channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); ACSPO clear-sky mask (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags, which also includes day/night, land, ice, twilight, and glint flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010); NCEP wind speed; and ACSPO SST minus reference (Canadian Met Centre 0.2deg L4 SST; available at http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/CMC0.2deg-CMC-L4-GLOB-v2.0). We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2 quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). Per GDS2 specifications, two additional Sensor-Specific Error Statistics layers (SSES bias and standard deviation) are reported in each pixel with QL=5. Note that users of ACSPO data have the flexibility to ignore the ACSM and derive their own clear-sky mask, and use BTs and SSTs in those pixels (which are saved over all valid water pixels). They may also ignore ACSPO SSTs, and derive their own SSTs from the original BTs. The ACSPO VIIRS L2P product is monitored and validated against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010) and MICROS (Liang and Ignatov, 2011). A reduced size (1GB/day), equal-angle gridded (0.02 deg resolution), ACSPO L3U product is also available at http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/VIIRS_NPP-OSPO-L3U-v2.4, where gridded L2P SSTs with QL=5 only are reported, and BT layers omitted."

This particular dataset is produced by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) in collaboration with the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in the United Kingdom. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day or more (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

Global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared channels (3.7, 10.8 and 12.0 micrometer) using a multispectral algorithm. Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiatiave transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions. This product is delivered at full resolution in satellite projection as metagranule corresponding to 3 minutes of acquisition.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage recorded on tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station. This particular dataset is derived from LAC data. Further binning and averaging of the 1.1 km LAC pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 2.2 km. The coverage of the LAC data can vary but generally contains scenes over the oceans adjacent to Australia and the North Indian Ocean."

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The MetOp-A platform is sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The NAR products are SST fields derived from 1km AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a 0.02 degree equal angle grid. In the processing chain, global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. A cloud mask is applied and SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared (IR) channels by using a multispectral technique.

The TRMM is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in November 1997. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N. In contrast to infrared SST observations, microwave retrievals can be measured through most clouds, and are also insensitive to water vapor and aerosols.

Remote Sensing Systems is the producer of these gridded TMI SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project. Although the product designation is ""L2P_GRIDDED"" it is in actuality a Level 3 Collated (L3C) product as defined in the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2.0. Its ""L2P_GRIDDED"" name derives from a deprecated specification in the early Pilot Project phase of GHRSST (pre 2008) and has remained for file naming continuity.

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

The NAR products are SST fields derived from direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics at 2 km resolution. An operational AVHRR cloud mask is applied based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including the use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. L2P data products are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). Although the dataset designation is ""L2P"" it is actually a ""L3C"" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP), the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for the GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of ""L2P""."

It carries ten sophisticated optical and radar instruments to provide continuous observation and monitoring of the Earth's land, atmosphere, oceans and ice caps. The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard the Envisat spacecraft is designed to meet the challenging task of monitoring and detecting the climate change signal of sea surface temperature (SST). It builds on the success of its predecessor instruments on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS)-1, and ERS-2 satellites, and will lead to a multi-decade record of precise and accurate global SST measurements, thereby making a valuable contribution to the long-term climate record. The exceptionally high radiometric accuracy and stability of AATSR data are achieved through a number of unique features. A comprehensive pre-launch calibration programme, combined with continuous in-flight calibration, ensures that the data are continually corrected for sensor drift and degradation. A ""dual-view"" algorithm offering improved atmospheric correction by applying two different atmospheric path lengths is used to derive the SSTskin observations. The accuracies achieved with this configuration are further enhanced by using low-noise infrared detectors, cooled to their optimum operating temperature by a pair of Stirling-cycle coolers. With its high-accuracy, high-quality imagery and channels in the visible, near-infrared and thermal wavelengths, AATSR data will support many applications in addition to oceanographic and climate research, including a wide range of land-surface, cryosphere and atmospheric studies. See Llewellyn-Jones et al (2001) ESA bulletin 105, Feb 2001 for a full description. These AATSR L2P SST data are produced as part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project according to the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5. This particular GHRSST AATSR dataset is produced by the UK Processing and Archiving (UPA) Centre Regional Data Assembly Facility (RDAC) for ESA since mid-2008. From the perspective of data format and quality it is identical to the L2P AATSR Medspiration (EUR) RDAC dataset produced earlier in the GHRSST Project."

The TRMM is part of the NASA's mission to planet Earth, and is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in 27 November 1997 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N. Remote Sensing Systems has produced a Version-4 TMI ocean SST dataset for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) by applying an algorithm to the 10.7 GHz channel through a removal of surface roughness effects. In contrast to infrared SST observations, microwave retrievals can be measured through clouds, which are nearly transparent at 10.7 GHz. Microwave retrievals are also insensitive to water vapor and aerosols. The algorithm for retrieving SSTs from radiometer data is described in ""AMSR Ocean Algorithm."""

",GHRSST-REMSS-L2P_GRIDDED_25-WSAT.xml,GHRSST,,,,,,,,"This dataset contains sea surface temperature derived from observations made by the WindSat Polarimetric Radiometer developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and launched on 6 January 2003 aboard the Department of Defense Coriolis satellite. This radiometer is well-calibrated and contains the lower frequency channels required for SST retrievals. The radiometer operates in 5 discrete bands: 6.8, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 37.0 GHz. The 10.7, 18.7 and 37.0 GHz bands are fully polarimetric whereas the 6.8 and 23.8 GHz bands have only dual polarization. The feedhorns of each frequency band trace out different arcs along the bench, therefore the Earth Incidence Angles (EIA) are different for each frequency band. Unlike previous radiometers, the WindSat sensor takes observations during both the forward and aft looking scans. This makes the WindSat geometry of the earth view swath quite different and significantly more complicated than the other passive microwave sensors. The Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, or REMSS) WindSat dataset is the only one available that uses both the fore and aft look directions which results in a wider swath and more complicated swath geometry visible in the provided maps. RSS produces these SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project. In the data processing chain, a first stage produces a near-real-time (NRT) dataset (identified with a ""rt"" within the file name) which is made as available as soon as possible. A later second stage produces a final dataset (identified by ""v7"" within the file name) that contains more data than the NRT version. In this dataset, both ascending (evening time) and descending (morning time) gridded orbital passes are packaged into the same daily file.

Although the product designation is ""L2P_GRIDDED"" it is in actuality a Level 3 Collated (L3C) product as defined in the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2.0. Its ""L2P_GRIDDED"" name derives from a deprecated specification in the early Pilot Project phase of GHRSST (pre 2008) and has remained for file naming continuity."

MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and 12 um spectrum are used. The Aqua platform is in a sun synchronous, near polar orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days.

The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm development, error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA ground data system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file format. JPL acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and reformats them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata. Data consists of global coverage at 1 km resolution with approximately 300+ five minute observation granules per day. For nighttime data both SST from the 11-12 um, and 4 um bands are available. Ocean chlorophyll a and K490 diffuse attenuation coefficient data are also available for daytime periods as non standard L2P core fields. Note that these ocean color data do not represent the most recent version processed by the OBPG and may not be of research quality."

This particular dataset is produced by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) in collaboration with the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in the United Kingdom. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day or more (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

NEODAAS-Dundee acquires approximately 15 AVHRR direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) passes per day over NW Europe and the Arctic. Each pass is approximately 15 minutes duration.

",GHRSST-JPL-L2P-MODIS_T.xml,GHRSST,,,,,,,,"The Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument (radiometer) launched by NASA in 1999 on board the Terra satellite platform (a second series is on the Aqua platform) to study global dynamics of the Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and 12 um spectrum are used. The Terra platform is in a sun synchronous, near polar orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days.

The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm development, error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA ground data system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file format. JPL acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and reformats them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata. Data consists of global coverage at 1 km resolution with approximately 300+ five minute observation granules per day. For nighttime data both SST from the 11-12 um, and 4 um bands are available. Ocean chlorophyll a and K490 diffuse attenuation coefficient data are also available for daytime periods as non standard L2P core fields. Note that these ocean color data do not represent the most recent version processed by the OBPG and may not be of research quality."

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage recorded on tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station. This particular dataset is derived from LAC data. Further binning and averaging of the 1.1 km LAC pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 2.2 km. The coverage of the LAC data can vary but generally contains scenes over the oceans adjacent to Australia and the North Indian Ocean."

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. This particular dataset is produced from GAC data that are derived from an on-board sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km resolution at nadir. Further binning and averaging of these pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 8.8 km."

The GCOM-W mission aims to establish the global and long-term observation system to collect data, which is needed to understand mechanisms of climate and water cycle variations, and demonstrate its utilization. AMSR2 onboard the first generation of the GCOM-W satellite will continue Aqua/AMSR-E observations of water vapor, cloud liquid water, precipitation, SST, sea surface wind speed, sea ice concentration, snow depth, and soil moisture. AMSR2 is a remote sensing instrument for measuring weak microwave emission from the surface and the atmosphere of the Earth. From about 700 km above the Earth, AMSR2 will provide us highly accurate measurements of the intensity of microwave emission and scattering. The antenna of AMSR2 rotates once per 1.5 seconds and obtains data over a 1450 km swath. This conical scan mechanism enables AMSR2 to acquire a set of daytime and nighttime data with more than 99% coverage of the Earth every 2 days. Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, or REMSS), providers of these SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project, performs a detailed processing of AMSR2 instrument data in two stages. The first stage produces a near-real-time (NRT) product (identified by ""_rt_"" within the file name) which is made as available as soon as possible. This is generally within 3 hours of when the data are recorded. Although suitable for many timely uses the NRT products are not intended to be archive quality. ""Final"" data (currently identified by ""v7.2"" within the file name) are processed when RSS receives the atmospheric model National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) Operational Global Analysis. The NCEP wind directions are particularly useful for retrieving more accurate SSTs and wind speeds.

The TRMM is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in November 1997. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N.

This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset is derived from Remote Sensing Systems BMAPS (binary) format TMI SST subskin data. Data were downloaded for the North Atlantic region from Remote Sensing Systems every hour to capture the latest TMI observations. L2P data products were then produced to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5. Ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) orbits are packaged into separate netCDF files.

Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle. This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset produced by Meteo France/ Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS), is derived from the SEVIRI instrument on the first MSG satellite (also known as Meteosat-8) that was launched on 28 August 2002. Skin sea surface temperature (SST) data are calculated from the infrared channels of SEVIRI at full resolution on a hourly basis. Remapping of original pixel size to 11.6 km resolution is made by spatial averaging, and a 3-hourly temporal resolution SST is created by averaging the hourly SSTs having the best confidence level. Data from different MSG satellites are not averaged together. L2P data products with Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5."

The MetOp satellite program is a European undertaking providing weather data services for monitoring climate and improving weather forecasts. It was jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with a contribution by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of an AVHRR sensor identical to those flying on the family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES). AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The MetOp-A platform is sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The production of the MetOp-A L2P SST data is done by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) in France. In the processing chain, global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at CMS through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. A cloud mask is applied and SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared (IR) channels by using a multispectral technique. The MetOp-A SST L2P data consist of global coverage at 1 km resolution separated into three minute observation granules, and are compliant with the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Data Specification (GDS) version 1.7."

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) is producing SST products in near real time from Metop/AVHRR. Global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared channels (3.7, 10.8 and 12.0 micrometer) using a multispectral algorithm.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. This particular dataset is derived from Local Area Coverage (LAC) binary AVHRR SST binary data originally produced by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) and downloaded from the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). LAC are full resolution AVHRR data whose acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. Finally, L2P data products are derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES)."

Generally there are several GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit at any one time viewing different earth locations including the GOES-11 launched 3 May 2000. The radiometer aboard the satellite, The GOES I-M Imager, is a five channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth. The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning telemetry in 10-bit precision. For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset, skin sea surface temperature (SST) measurements are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-11 at full resolution on a half hourly basis. In native satellite projection, vertically adjacent pixels are averaged and read out at every pixel. L2P datasets including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5. The full disk image is subsetted into granules representing distinct northern and southern regions."

For each valid water pixel (defined as ocean, sea, lake or river, and up to 5 km inland), the following layers are reported: SSTs, ACSPO clear-sky mask (ACSM; provided in each grid as part of l2p_flags, which also includes day/night, land, ice, twilight, and glint flags), NCEP wind speed, and ACSPO SST minus reference (Canadian Met Centre 0.2deg L4 SST). Only L2P SSTs with QL=5 were gridded, so all valid SSTs are recommended for the users. Per GDS2 specifications, two additional Sensor-Specific Error Statistics layers (SSES bias and standard deviation) are reported in each pixel with valid SST. The ACSPO VIIRS L3U product is monitored and validated against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010)."

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) is producing SST products in near real time from GOES 13 in East position. GOES 13 imager level 1 data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system.
SST is retrieved from the GOES 13 infrared channels (3.9 and 10.8 micrometer) using a multispectral algorithm. Due to the lack of 12 micrometer channel in the GOES 13 imager, SST retrieval is not possible in daytime conditions. Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiatiave transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions.Every 30 minutes slot is processed at full satellite resolution. The operational products are then produced by remapping over a 0.05 degree regular grid (60S-60N and 135W-15W) SST fields obtained by aggregating 30 minute SST data available in one hour time, and the priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour.

This particular dataset is produced by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) in collaboration with the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in the United Kingdom. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day or more (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

NEODAAS-Dundee acquires approximately 15 AVHRR direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) passes per day over NW Europe and the Arctic. Each pass is approximately 15 minutes duration. These are immediately transferred to NEODAAS-Plymouth where they are processed into sea surface temperature (SST) products and converted to L2P specifications."

This particular dataset is produced by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) in collaboration with the National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in the United Kingdom. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day or more (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

NEODAAS-Dundee acquires approximately 15 AVHRR direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) passes per day over NW Europe and the Arctic. Each pass is approximately 15 minutes duration. These are immediately transferred to NEODAAS-Plymouth where they are processed into sea surface temperature (SST) products and converted to L2P specifications."

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The MetOp-A platform is sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The NAR products are SST fields derived from 1km AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a 0.02 degree equal angle grid. In the processing chain, global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. A cloud mask is applied and SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared (IR) channels by using a multispectral technique. The MetOp-A SST L3P data are compliant with the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Data Specification (GDS) version 1.7."

The NAR products are SST fields derived from direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics at 2 km resolution. An operational AVHRR cloud mask is applied based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including the use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. L2P data products are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). Although the dataset designation is ""L2P"" it is actually a ""L3C"" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP), the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for the GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of ""L2P""."

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km.

The NAR products are SST fields derived from direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics at 2 km resolution. An operational AVHRR cloud mask is applied based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including the use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. L2P data products are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). Although the dataset designation is ""L2P"" it is actually a ""L3C"" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP), the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for the GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of ""L2P""."

The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) provided AMSR-E to NASA as an indispensable part of Aqua's global hydrology mission. Over the oceans, AMSR-E is measuring a number of important geophysical parameters, including sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, atmospheric water vapor, cloud water, and rain rate. A key feature of AMSR-E is its capability to see through clouds, thereby providing an uninterrupted view of global SST and surface wind fields. Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, or REMSS) is the provider of these SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project, performs a detailed processing of AMSR-E instrument data in two stages. The first stage produces a near-real-time (NRT) product (identified by ""_rt_"" within the file name) which is made as available as soon as possible. This is generally within 3 hours of when the data are recorded. Although suitable for many timely uses the NRT products are not intended to be archive quality. ""Final"" data (currently identified by ""v7"" within the file name) are processed when RSS receives the atmospheric model National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) Operational Global Analysis.

It carries ten sophisticated optical and radar instruments to provide continuous observation and monitoring of the Earth's land, atmosphere, oceans and ice caps. The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard the Envisat spacecraft is designed to meet the challenging task of monitoring and detecting the climate change signal of sea surface temperature (SST). It builds on the success of its predecessor instruments on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS)-1, and ERS-2 satellites, and will lead to a multi-decade record of precise and accurate global SST measurements, thereby making a valuable contribution to the long-term climate record. The exceptionally high radiometric accuracy and stability of AATSR data are achieved through a number of unique features. A comprehensive pre-launch calibration programme, combined with continuous in-flight calibration, ensures that the data are continually corrected for sensor drift and degradation. A ""dual-view"" algorithm offering improved atmospheric correction by applying two different atmospheric path lengths is used to derive the SSTskin observations. The accuracies achieved with this configuration are further enhanced by using low-noise infrared detectors, cooled to their optimum operating temperature by a pair of Stirling-cycle coolers. With its high-accuracy, high-quality imagery and channels in the visible, near-infrared and thermal wavelengths, AATSR data will support many applications in addition to oceanographic and climate research, including a wide range of land-surface, cryosphere and atmospheric studies. See Llewellyn-Jones et al (2001) ESA bulletin 105, Feb 2001 for a full description. These AATSR L2P SST data are produced as part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project according to the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5.

The TRMM is part of the NASA's mission to planet Earth, and is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in 27 November 1997 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N. Remote Sensing Systems has produced a Version-4 TMI ocean SST dataset for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) by applying an algorithm to the 10.7 GHz channel through a removal of surface roughness effects. In contrast to infrared SST observations, microwave retrievals can be measured through clouds, which are nearly transparent at 10.7 GHz. Microwave retrievals are also insensitive to water vapor and aerosols. The algorithm for retrieving SSTs from radiometer data is described in ""AMSR Ocean Algorithm."""

The MetOp satellite program is a European undertaking providing weather data services for monitoring climate and improving weather forecasts. It was jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with a contribution by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of an AVHRR sensor identical to those flying on the family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES). AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The MetOp-A platform is sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. This particular dataset is produced from Global Area Coverage (GAC) data that are derived from an on-board sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km resolution at nadir. Further binning and averaging of these pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 8.8 km."

Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. This particular dataset is produced from GAC data that are derived from an on-board sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km resolution at nadir. Further binning and averaging of these pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 8.8 km."

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands.

The NAR products are SST fields derived from 1km AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a 0.02 degree equal angle grid. In the processing chain, global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. A cloud mask is applied and SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared (IR) channels by using a multispectral technique.

The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) provided AMSR-E to NASA as an indispensable part of Aqua's global hydrology mission. Over the oceans, AMSR-E is measuring a number of important geophysical parameters, including sea-surface temperature (SST), wind speed, atmospheric water vapor, cloud water, and rain rate. A key feature of AMSR-E is its capability to see through clouds, thereby providing an uninterrupted view of global SST and surface wind fields. Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, or REMSS) is the provider of these SST data for the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project. Although the product designation is ""L2P_GRIDDED"" it is in actuality a Level 3 Collated (L3C) product as defined in the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2.0. Its ""L2P_GRIDDED"" name derives from a deprecated specification in the early Pilot Project phase of GHRSST (pre 2008) and has remained for file naming continuity.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. GAC data provide daily subsampled global coverage recorded on tape recorders and then transmitted to a ground station. This particular dataset is derived from LAC data. Further binning and averaging of the 1.1 km LAC pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 2.2 km.

The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. AVHRR data are acquired in three formats: High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), Local Area Coverage (LAC), and Global Area Coverage (GAC). HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground stations as they are collected. LAC are also full resolution data, but the acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. This particular dataset is produced from GAC data that are derived from an on-board sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km resolution at nadir. Further binning and averaging of these pixels results in a final dataset resolution of 8.8 km."

The TRMM is a joint venture between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to measure precipitation, water vapor, SST and wind in the global tropical regions and was launched in November 1997. The TRMM satellite travels west to east in a 402 km altitude semi-equatorial precessing orbit that results in day-to-day changes in the observation time of any given earth location between 38S and 38N.

This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset is derived from Remote Sensing Systems BMAPS (binary) format TMI SST subskin data. Data were downloaded for the North Atlantic region from Remote Sensing Systems every hour to capture the latest TMI observations. L2P data products were then produced to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5. Ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) orbits are packaged into separate netCDF files.

Although the dataset designation is ""L2P"" it is actually a ""L3C"" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project, the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of ""L2P""."

The MetOp satellite program is a European undertaking providing weather data services for monitoring climate and improving weather forecasts. It was jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with a contribution by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of an AVHRR sensor identical to those flying on the family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES). AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The MetOp-A platform is sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The production of the MetOp-A L2P SST data is done by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) in France. In the processing chain, global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at CMS through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. A cloud mask is applied and SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared (IR) channels by using a multispectral technique. The MetOp-A SST L2P data consist of global coverage at 1 km resolution separated into three minute observation granules, and are compliant with the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Data Specification (GDS) version 1.7."

",,GHRSST-EUR-L2P-AMSRE.xml,GHRSST,,,,,,,,"The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) was launched on 4 May 2002, aboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft. The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) provided AMSR-E to NASA as an indispensable part of Aqua's global hydrology mission. Over the oceans, AMSR-E is measuring a number of important geophysical parameters, including sea-surface temperature (SST), wind speed, atmospheric water vapor, cloud water, and rain rate. A key feature of AMSR-E is its capability to see through clouds, thereby providing an uninterrupted view of global SST and surface wind fields.

This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset is derived from Remote Sensing Systems BMAPS (binary) format AMSR-E SST subskin data. Data were downloaded for North Atlantic region from Remote Sensing Systems every hour to capture the latest AMSRE observations. L2P data products were then produced to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5.

Ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) orbits are packaged into separate netCDF files.

Although the dataset designation is ""L2P"" it is actually a ""L3C"" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project, the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of ""L2P""."

It carries ten sophisticated optical and radar instruments to provide continuous observation and monitoring of the Earth's land, atmosphere, oceans and ice caps. The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) onboard the Envisat spacecraft is designed to meet the challenging task of monitoring and detecting the climate change signal of sea surface temperature (SST). It builds on the success of its predecessor instruments on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS)-1, and ERS-2 satellites, and will lead to a multi-decade record of precise and accurate global SST measurements, thereby making a valuable contribution to the long-term climate record. The exceptionally high radiometric accuracy and stability of AATSR data are achieved through a number of unique features. A comprehensive pre-launch calibration programme, combined with continuous in-flight calibration, ensures that the data are continually corrected for sensor drift and degradation. A ""dual-view"" algorithm offering improved atmospheric correction by applying two different atmospheric path lengths is used to derive the SSTskin observations. The accuracies achieved with this configuration are further enhanced by using low-noise infrared detectors, cooled to their optimum operating temperature by a pair of Stirling-cycle coolers. With its high-accuracy, high-quality imagery and channels in the visible, near-infrared and thermal wavelengths, AATSR data will support many applications in addition to oceanographic and climate research, including a wide range of land-surface, cryosphere and atmospheric studies. See Llewellyn-Jones et al (2001) ESA bulletin 105, Feb 2001 for a full description. These AATSR L2P SST data are produced as part of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Project according to the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5. This particular GHRSST AATSR dataset is produced by the UK Processing and Archiving (UPA) Centre Regional Data Assembly Facility (RDAC) for ESA since mid-2008.

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) is producing SST products in near real time from Metop/AVHRR. Global AVHRR level 1b data are acquired at Meteo-France/Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) through the EUMETSAT/EUMETCAST system. SST is retrieved from the AVHRR infrared channels (3.7, 10.8 and 12.0 micrometer) using a multispectral algorithm. Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, together with a radiatiave transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions. This global L3C product is derived from full resolution AVHRR l1b data that are re-mapped onto a 0.05 degree grid twice daily. The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2."

This Research to Operations (RTO) analysis is based upon a composite of either nighttime or daytime GHRSST L2P skin SST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, and subskin SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE). Four unique products (composites) are created: MODIS Terra/AMSRE day and night, and MODIS Aqua/AMSRE day and night. This particular dataset represents a MODIS Terra and AMSRE composite using nighttime data. The algorithm is based on a weighting scheme and compositing wherby MODIS data are used if they exist to preserve the highest resolution possible.

","NCEI's partnership with all NOAA line offices and academia enables the long-term preservation of publicly funded data.

Through national commitment SAMOS Creates quality estimates of the heat, moisture, momentum, and radiation fluxes at the air-sea interface; Improves our understanding of the biases and uncertainties in global air-sea fluxes; Benchmarks new satellite and model products; And provides high quality observations to support modeling activities (e.g., reanalysis) and global climate programs.

SAMOS plans to improve access to quality assured SAMOS data for scientific and operational users by providing free and open access to data and metadata; Expand availability of SAMOS observations collected in remote ocean regions (e.g., Southern Ocean); Improve the accuracy and calibration of SAMOS measurements; Provide standards for data and metadata collected on SAMOS equipped vessel; Ensure routine archival of SAMOS data at world data centers; Develop documentation and training materials for use by data collectors and the user community; Support comparison studies between in-situ platforms (e.g., R/Vs, VOS, buoys); And develop partnerships in the international marine community.

",,COAPS-SAMOS.xml,SAMOS,,,,,,,,"The Florida State University has been operating a data assembly center (DAC) to collect, quality evaluate, and distribute Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS) observations since 2005. SAMOS are typically a computerized data logging system that records underway meteorological and near-surface oceanographic observations collected on research vessels. The SAMOS initiative does not provide specific instrumentation for vessels, but instead takes advantage of science quality instrumentation already deployed on research vessels and select merchant ships. The SAMOS initiative provides vessel operators with desired sampling protocols and metadata requirements that will ensure the DAC receives a consistent series of observations from each vessel. The DAC and its partners in U. S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System, the U. S. Coast Guard, and the U. S. Antarctic Program have implemented a series of daily data transmission from ship-to-shore using an email protocol. A set of observations recorded at one-minute intervals for the previous day arrive at the DAC soon after 0000 UTC and undergo automated quality evaluation. A trained data analyst reviews data and responds directly to vessels at sea when problems are identified. A secondary level of visual quality control is completed after all data fro a single ship and day are merged into a common daily file (allowing for delayed data receipts). All quality-evaluated data are freely available to the user community (via http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu) and are distributed to national archive centers. This project is supported by the NOAA Climate Observation Division."

These data are produced by the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Suomi NPP Data Exploitation (NDE) system, and is an EDR that contains pinpoint locations of active fires as identified by an algorithm initially created for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Aqua and Terra satellites, but improved upon and adapted for use by VIIRS. The algorithm utilizes sensor data from the 4 micron and 11 micron spectral bands (M13 and M15), to deliver locations and fire radiative properties of active fires on the earth's surface. In addition, the improved NDE algorithms deliver an improved fire mask and fire radiative power retrievals (FRP). VIIRS infrared bands have a spatial resolution of 750 meters at nadir, and 375 meters at nadir for the imagery bands, as such the sensor is sensitive enough to detect fires at sea, which is an improvement over the previous Active Fires product produced by the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS). By default, VIIRS data obtained from the Comprehensive Large Array-Data Stewardship System (CLASS) are distributed in four 86-second granules in Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5)."

NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. The NEXRAD products are divided into multiple data processing levels. The lower Level II data contain the three meteorological base data quantities at original resolution: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width. With the advent of dual polarization beginning in 2011, additional base products of differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient and differential phase are available. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. NEXRAD data are acquired by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from June 1991 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous."

The U.S. AMLR Program is managed by NOAA Fisheries' Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division (AERD) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. 

The research completed in the field is used to describe the Antarctic ecosystem as a function of the relationships among Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), their predators, 
and the physical and biological oceanographic conditions of Antarctic waters. Two working hypotheses form the basis of research conducted by the U.S. AMLR Program: 

1) krill predators respond to changes in the availability of their food source, and 

2) the distribution of krill is affected by both physical and biological aspects of their habitat.

The primary objectives of the bioacoustic survey were to map the meso-scale dispersion of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands and to determine their association with predator foraging patterns, water mass boundaries, spatial patterns of primary productivity, and bathymetry. In addition, efforts were made to map the distribution of myctophids and to determine their relationship with water mass boundaries and zooplankton distribution."

The primary goal of this study is to determine the temperature structure of Juan de Fuca basement and overlying accretionary prism sediments that comprise the CSZ deformation zone with a transect of systematic heat flow and fluid flux profiles off the Washington Coast. Temperature is a primary controlling factor of many subduction zone processes, particularly at active margins that are subject to large magnitude, megathrust earthquakes as the CSZ offshore WA, and a comprehensive heat flow study of the Cascadia Corridor is a fundamental parameter required by the Scientific Plan of the GeoPRISM Program. Compilation of existing data demonstrate that the segment of the CSZ off-shore WA is dramatically under-measured, with only sparse heat flow stations made during programs focused on other scientific goals. We are proposing to acquire a systematic profile of heat flow and fluid flux measurements along a corridor of the accretionary prism on the Washington margin at 47N, from west of the deformation front on the abyssal plain to just below the shelf edge at 500 m depth in order to make the first quantitative estimates of the thermal structure of the 'locked zone' of the Cascadia megathrust. To obtain an accurate estimate of conductive heat flux from the challenging environment of the accretionary prism, we plan redundant methods to obtain both thermal and fluid flux measurements along a 2.5 D profile of the margin at a single latitude. In this profile we would use thermal blankets suitable for impenetrable sub-stratum, continuous fluid flow meters, multi-core deployments for sediment pore water chemistry and thermal gradient measurements, and Jason-II heat flow probes."

We propose to deploy experiments/sample a low temperature diffuse flow vent (e.g., Crab Spa; T: 10-30?C), and a higher temperature vent (e.g., L-vent; T: 30-60?C). Furthermore, we will carry out additional opportunistic sampling for a limited set of parameters (e.g., chemistry, 454- pyrotags, FISH, in situ carbon fixation) of vents that fall into these two categories, or that might have developed since the last visit to the site (May 2012). During the course of the cruise we will collect biomass from fluids and biofilms (deployment/recover experimental microbial colonizers) by utilizing a Large Volume Pump (LVP) (McLane WTS 6-1-142LV). We have successfully used this set up in previous cruises and were able to collect up to ~2,000 liters of hydrothermal fluids resulting in enough biomass (cell density is 2-5 x 105 cells per ml) for subsequent ?omic? analyses. During large volume filtration, the volume filtered is recorded by the LVP onboard computer and the vent fluid sampled is monitored with a time series temperature probe, H2S, and pH sensors. Fluid samples for chemical analyses will be collected at each deployment site using the isobaric gas-tight samplers, which will also be used to sample fluids from the two focus sites for the shipboard incubations. Finally, we will deployment/recover experimental microbial colonizers to collect microbial biofilms.We have successfully used these devices in previous cruises to collect sufficient biomass for metatranscriptomic analyses."

However, there are aspects of vehicle operation and performance that are critical to science but not necessarily included in the certification process as defined by the US Navy?s NAVSEA protocols. Consequently, a science verification cruise (SVC) will be conducted to assess the research capabilities of the vehicle. The specific objectives of the cruise will include: 1) involvement of experienced users to ensure operational components and scientific sensors on the vehicle are working properly, 2) pursuit of various science projects and opportunistic exploration, and 3) education of early career scientists who plan to conduct deep submergence field science using HOV Alvin."

Surveys have been conducted either annually or biennially since 1994. The 2012 acoustic-trawl (AT) survey was carried out between 7 June and 10 August aboard the NOAA ship Oscar Dyson. Its primary objective was to collect acoustic and trawl information to estimate walleye pollock midwater abundance and distribution on the U.S. and Russian Bering Sea shelf. Additional survey sampling included conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) casts to characterize the Bering Sea shelf physical environment, and supplemental trawls to improve acoustic species classification and to obtain an index of euphausiid abundance using multiple frequency techniques. A number of specialized sampling devices were used during the survey, including light level sensors; a Simrad ME70 multibeam sonar to image fish schools; an 83-112 bottom trawl modified to sample fish in midwater; a trawl-mounted stereo camera (""Cam-Trawl"") designed to identify species and determine size and density of animals as they pass by the camera during a haul, and a small, bottom-moored, trigger camera system to autonomously collect images of fish on the seafloor."

However, the ECS Task Force considered the Mendocino Ridge might be a potential extension for the U.S. The Mayer et al. (2002) report recommended that multibeam echosounder (MBES) data are needed to rigorously define (1) the foot of the slope (FoS), a parameter of the two UNCLOS-stipulated formula lines, and (2) the 2500-m isobath, a parameter of one of the UNCLOS-stipulated cutoff lines. Both of these parameters, the first a precise geodetic isobath and second a geomorphic zone, are used to define an extended continental shelf claim. The Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) of the University of New Hampshire was directed by the U.S. Congress, through funding to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to conduct the new surveys and archive the resultant data."

About one half of the shelf portion of the canyon was mapped with Eagle Ray between 2007 aboard Ronald H. Brown and 2008 aboard Henry B. Bigelow. We seek to complete the mapping of the shelf segment of the Hudson Canyon on this cruise; 2) perform visual ground truthing of areas up to 1,000 m deep in Hudson Canyon using the NIUST AUV Mola Mola. In particular, we will be investigating ravines in canyon walls mapped by Eagle Ray for vulnerable deepwater coral and sponge communities, tilefish pueblo villages, and suspected areas of methane blowouts in the canyon bottom for vulnerable chemosynthetic communities. Such vulnerable communities may be at risk due to overlap with deepsea red crab, witch flounder, and/or monkfish distributions. The intention is to detect and locate vulnerable communities and also to gain experience for development of protocols for further exploration for vulnerable deepwater habitats in canyon and slope areas; 3) perform a series of CTD/rosette sampler casts down the canyon to a maximum depth of about 1,200 m in the canyon axis. This will provide a near-synoptic, 3-dimensional view of water mass interaction around Hudson Canyon and allow collection of water samples at multiple depths for dissolved methane analysis. The latter will help resolve the source of elevated methane previously detected in deep water within Hudson Canyon. Possible discovery of a local seep raises the possibility of a chemosynthetic community supported by that feature; and 4) collect ME70 multibeam sonar data for purposes of benthic mapping in order to resolve some issues encountered during summer 2008 cruises for that purpose."

About one half of the shelf portion of the canyon was mapped with Eagle Ray between 2007 aboard Ronald H. Brown and 2008 aboard Henry B. Bigelow. We seek to complete the mapping of the shelf segment of the Hudson Canyon on this cruise; 2) perform visual ground truthing of areas up to 1,000 m deep in Hudson Canyon using the NIUST AUV Mola Mola. In particular, we will be investigating ravines in canyon walls mapped by Eagle Ray for vulnerable deepwater coral and sponge communities, tilefish pueblo villages, and suspected areas of methane blowouts in the canyon bottom for vulnerable chemosynthetic communities. Such vulnerable communities may be at risk due to overlap with deepsea red crab, witch flounder, and/or monkfish distributions. The intention is to detect and locate vulnerable communities and also to gain experience for development of protocols for further exploration for vulnerable deepwater habitats in canyon and slope areas; 3) perform a series of CTD/rosette sampler casts down the canyon to a maximum depth of about 1,200 m in the canyon axis. This will provide a near-synoptic, 3-dimensional view of water mass interaction around Hudson Canyon and allow collection of water samples at multiple depths for dissolved methane analysis. The latter will help resolve the source of elevated methane previously detected in deep water within Hudson Canyon. Possible discovery of a local seep raises the possibility of a chemosynthetic community supported by that feature; and 4) collect ME70 multibeam sonar data for purposes of benthic mapping in order to resolve some issues encountered during summer 2008 cruises for that purpose."

Bigelow. They will use a remotedly operated vehicle (ROV) owned by Canada. Called the Remotely Operated Platform for Ocean Science-- ROPOS for short -- the vehicle can record images and sample water, sediments, and marine life using sampling gear operated from the ship by ROPOS pilots. The sites to be sampled range from 200 to 3000 meters deep, or roughly 650 to 10,000 feet deep. The ROPOS generally works in the Pacific Ocean, and this cruise marks the first time the vehicle has been used for coral research in U.S.Atlantic waters."

The project utilizes new data obtained from both remote instrumentation (e.g. moorings,satellites) and an interdisciplinary ship-based field program to gain a better understanding of the physical/chemical conditions that favor under-ice bloom development as well as the physiological adaptations that allow phytoplankton to flourish beneath sea ice. The long-standing paradigm of the Arctic Ocean is one in which phytoplankton proliferate at the ice edge, supplying a substantial fraction of annual NPP and concentrating much of the food
web in the MIZ. However, if under-ice phytoplankton blooms are widespread, then current estimates of annual NPP on Arctic continental shelves may be >10-fold too low. Our research program will allow us to determine the extent of under-ice blooms on the Chukchi Shelf and provide better estimates of production in these seasonally ice covered waters. It will also provide an improved understanding of the timing of phytoplankton blooms under the ice, in the MIZ, and in the open waters of the Chukchi Shelf, as well as the mechanisms controlling them."

Ricker, both are stern trawlers equipped for fisheries and oceanographic research. Pacific Hake (Merluccius productus) aggregations were targeted along the continental shelf and upper slope of the entire survey area. 

Hake populations were surveyed along a series of parallel line transects that in general were oriented east-west, spaced at an interval of 10 nmi apart, and traversed sequentially in alternating directions; The survey on Miller Freeman (US portion) began from north of Point Piedras Blancas, CA (35.8?N) to the northwest tip of Washington state (48.4?N) between June 30 and Aug. 22, while the survey on W.E. Ricker began from near US/Canada border (48.55?N) to the Dixon Entrance area, Canada (54.9?N) between Aug. 13 to Sep. 7. All transects up to the Dixon Entrance and along the west coast of Haida Gwaii were completed. Sea depth at the inshore end of individual transects was nominally 50 m. Offshore extent of individual transects was typically at a depth of 1,500 m. However, this package includes only the EK60 raw data from the US portion only."

Scientists will collect high resolution multibeam and acoustic fisheries data in midwater depths approximately 30 to 1000 meters so as to continue to characterize seafloor habitats within all U.S. States, Territories, and Commonwealths. The objective of this project is to collect a multibeam bathymetry dataset with 100% seafloor ensonification, along with multibeam backscatter suitable for seafloor characterization. Fishery acoustics data will be collected to characterize broad-scale fish abundance, biomass, and utilization patterns, as well as to locate and document fish spawning aggregations. Multibeam data will be collected to conform to IHO Order 1 (<100m) and Order 2 (>100m) accuracy standards. The strategies developed for each survey area will take into account the minimum depths, general bathymetry, and time allotment. The delineation and identification of seafloor habitats will be assisted by the use of a moderatedepth Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and drop camera. The vehicle has video and frame camera capability to depths of 300 meters and will be used to point sampling within areas mapped during this mission."

Data collected consisted of CTD casts, trawl samples, and continuous monitoring of currents and biological acoustic backscatter. CTD cats were conducted at predetermined stations. CTDs were equipped with oxygen sensors and fluorometers, and water was sampled at discrete depths during each cast for chloropigment determinations. Trawl operations were conducted at predetermined stations using a Cobb trawl at depths of the shallow (nighttime) and deep (day and nighttime) sound scattering layers. Currents were continuously monitored using a RD Instruments Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) operating at 75 kHz frequency. Biological backscatter were recorded using the EK60 echosounder system (38, & 120 kHz) along predetermined transects."

However, on July 12, 2010, FSV Pisces was directed to participate in the response to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill by monitoring the area around the well head using Simrad EK60 echo sounders while pressure testing of the cap installed on the well was conducted. This testing period was expected to last for 24 to 48 hours, after which the scheduled workshop would commence. Pisces monitoring effort was later extended and continued through July 20, precluding completion of almost all of the multibeam sonar workshop objectives.

Pisces departed Pascagoula at about 1800 CDT on July 14 and proceeded toward DWH. Clearance to begin operations near DWH was received at 2230 on July 15 and survey operations began at 0000 on July 16 and continued until 0000 on July 20 after which Pisces returned to Pascagoula. Acoustic surveys using Simrad EK60 split beam echo sounders at 18, 38, 120, and 200 kHz and ME70 multibeam echo sounder at 70-120 kHz were conducted along transects spaced 0.1 run apart in the area around DWH. The survey was completed in rectangular areas using north-south and east-west transects at ranges from 1500 m to 2.5 run from DWH. At ranges within 1500 meters of DWH, a free-form survey was conducted to maneuver around other ship traffic and stationary platforms and cover as much of the space around the well head as possible including a large number of passes directly over the well. Data were also collected along transects running from southwest to northeast in an area northwest of DWH where earlier seismic measurements had shown fault lines below the sea floor running in generally that same direction.

During the survey, the echo sounder systems were used to observe a number of sonar targets that are assumed to be locations where methane or other gas bubbles are being released from the seabed. These are known to occur naturally in this area and most of the observations can be attributed to natural seeps. Similar observations were made intermittently directly over the DWH well head and appear to indicate gas that was escaping from the well. Other sonar targets observed are believed to be riser pipes, ROV tethers, and other equipment associated with the DWH response activity as well as sunken wreckage of the DWH platform on the sea floor."

The NOAA ship Pisces departed Morehead City, NC on 24 July 2012 for a SEFIS research cruise in continental shelf and shelf-break waters off the southeastern U.S. During this survey, 385 sq km of multibeam data were collected from 29 discrete areas in the sea area of Raleigh Bay, NC. A total of 328 concomitant trap-camera samples were collected. During PC1204, Caris multibeam processing methods were used at sea for the first time. SEFIS program website:

Operational objectives are to: (1) collect underway data using TSG, SCS, and ADCP; (2) complete CTD and bongo operations at stations throughout area, (3) calibrate the EK60 Scientific Sounder, (4) conduct acoustic surveys using the EK60, (5) collect biological data to verify species-specific acoustic measurements using midwater trawls, (6) collect marine mammal and seabird observations."

Water samples were preserved for post-cruise flow cytometry to determine phytoplankton size structure. Biological backscatter was monitored using the EK60 echosounder system, both during trawl operations and along 17 acoustic transects (including at least one daytime and one nighttime transit of each transect). Twelve nighttime oblique mid-water trawls were conducted, with replicate trawls at each of six sites. These trawls all targeted the shallow sound scattering layer. Data on cetacean distribution, school size, and school composition were collected with a towed passive acoustic array on 14 transects, including both a daytime and nighttime transit of each transect.

CTD-mounted fluorometer measurements were carried out by two fluorometers. Biological backscatter was monitored using the EK60 echosounder system, both during trawl operations and along 7 acoustic transects (including at least one daytime and one nighttime transit of each transect). One nighttime oblique mid-water trawl was conducted prior to the net being damaged beyond repair by contact with the seafloor. Four casts of a DIDSON imaging sonar were conducted to collect high resolution information on the density of high sonic scattering layers. An ROV was deployed 5 times to investigate acoustic scattering layers and adjacent layers. Deep handline jigging was accomplished during day and night to investigate scattering layer macrofauna. Data on cetacean distribution, school size, and school composition were collected via daytime visual surveys on 9 days of transects coupled with several days of small boat survey effort. Two HARP units were deployed for passive autonomous detection of cetaceans and several sonabuoys were also deployed during daytime operations for cetacean detection and identification."

Shimada and the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) W.E. Ricker. Both vessels are stern trawlers equipped for fisheries and oceanographic research. The Shimada surveyed from 35.8?N to 50.8?N between June 25 and August 23, and the Ricker surveyed from 48.8?N to 55.3?N between August 15 and September 6. The industry-provided vessel the F/V Forum Star was primarily for groudtruthing activity, trawling with an Aleutian wing trawl 24/20 (AWT), and remained in the vicinity the Shimada between June 28 and August 11. 

The portion of the survey conducted with the Bell M. Shimada focuses on both Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), a Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Acoustic and Trawl Survey of Pacific Hake and Pacific Sardine (SaKe 2012) covered the area from the Southern California Bight (SCB), CA to north end of the Vancouver Island, Canada. The data include here are those collected on NOAA Ship Bell M. Shimada only, i.e. Sake 2012 data only.

Hake and sardine populations were surveyed along a series of parallel line transects that in general were oriented east-west, spaced at an interval of 10 nmi apart, and traversed sequentially in alternating directions; some areas in Canadian waters were better covered with transects that ran in a zigzag or north-south orientation. The survey began northwest of Morro Bay, California, proceeded north toward Dixon Entrance, and finished along the west side of Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands). Hake aggregations were targeted along the continental shelf and upper slope of the entire survey area, whereas sardine aggregations were targeted only as far north as the northern tip of Vancouver Island. The Shimada was tasked with completing transects up to the north end of Vancouver Island, from which point the Ricker completed the remaining transects north to Dixon Entrance and along the west coast of Haida Gwaii. Sea depth at the inshore end of individual transects was nominally 30 m, although a few transects ended in waters deeper than 30 m because of restricted areas, navigation hazards, or boat traffic. Offshore extent of individual transects was typically at a depth of 1,500 m or at a point 35 nmi west of the inshore waypoint, whichever resulted in a longer transect."

The survey began in the SCB, proceeded north toward Dixon Entrance, and finished along the west side of Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands). In the SCB, nine parallel line transects (spaced roughly 20 nmi apart and oriented northeast-southwest) spanned from San Diego to Point Conception. Approximately 30 nmi north of Point Conception, acoustic transects assumed an east-west orientation, were spaced 10 nmi apart, and ranged from the 30-m isobath (or as close to shore as was safely navigable) to either the 1,500-m isobath or a location 35 nmi west of the inshore waypoint, whichever was farther offshore. (Transects north of Vancouver Island went inshore to the 50-m isobath or as close to shore as was safely navigable.) Transects in Dixon Entrance had a northsouth orientation. A few transects along the west coast of Haida Gwaii were run as modified zigzags due to time constraints. The Shimada was tasked with completing transects up to the north end of Vancouver Island, at which point the Ricker would complete the remainder. All transects were traversed sequentially, usually in alternating directions. When hake were detected at the offshore end of a transect, the vessel proceeded west to the end of the hake sign and then beyond for an additional 0.5 nmi to ensure that the end of the aggregation was located. This protocol was in place to ensure that the interpolation algorithm calculated the correct biomass at the offshore ends of transects."

Eastern and western extents will primarily range from the 20-m isobath or as close to shore as is safely navigable, to either the 1,500-m isobath or a point 35 nmi west of the inshore waypoint, whichever is farther offshore. The primary goal of the survey is to estimate the biomasses, distributions, and biological compositions of populations of Pacific hake and CPS using data from an integrated acoustic and trawl survey off the west coasts of the U.S. and Canada from approximately San Diego, California (lat 32?48.02?N) to the Dixon Entrance, Canada (lat 54?39.00?N). Besides Pacific sardine, the other CPS of interest for the SWFSC are those comprised in the Pacific Fisheries Management Council Fisheries Management Plan (PFMC, 2011) including: Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific Mackerel (Scomber japonicus), Jack Mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). The NWFSC and SWFSC are interested in all species of euphausiids found within the U.S.? West Coast EEZ. The current sampling resolution will probably not allow for a comprehensive assessment of all anchovy sub-populations. In particular, those residing in the Southern California Bight and off the Columbia River plume might require additional effort given their patchy distribution. SaKe 2015 will continue to monitor the populations of Ecosystem Component Species (ECS; PFMC, 2011), in particular Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii). Continuously sample multi-frequency acoustic backscatter data using the ship?s Simrad EK60 scientific echosounder system. These data will be used to estimate the distributions and abundances of hake and the CPS assemblage. Conduct daytime trawling to classify observed backscatter layers to species and size composition and to collect specimens of hake and other organisms. Conduct nighttime (i.e., between sunset and sunrise) surface trawling to collect specimens of coastal pelagic fishes (CPS) and other organisms. These data will be used to classify CPS backscatter to species and their size distributions. Nighttime sampling operations will conclude in time for the ship to resume running east-west acoustic transects by sunrise. Image fish using a portable X-radiograph machine for the purpose of target strength modeling and estimation. Collect a variety of other acoustic, biological, and oceanographic samples relevant to hake and CPS distributions. These data are vital for the surveys and assessments of hake and CPS. Continuously sample sea-surface temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a using the ship?s thermosalinograph and fluorometer. These data will be used to estimate the physical oceanographic habitats for each target species. Continuously sample air temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed and direction using the ship?s integrated weather station. Continuously sample pelagic fish eggs using the Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES). The data will be used to estimate the distributions and abundances of spawning hake, and multiple CPS. Sample profiles of temperature and salinity using a combination of an underway conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system during the day or a standard CTD system with water-sampling rosette and other instruments at nighttime stations, as time allows. Sample plankton using a Vertical Ring Net net at nighttime stations, as time allows. These data will be used to estimate the distribution and abundance of ichthyoplankton and zooplankton species. Continuously sample multi-frequency acoustic backscatter data using the ship?s Simrad ME70 multibeam echosounder system, synchronized and configured to not interfere with the EK60s. Optically verify CPS backscatter while underway conducting acoustic transects, using a cast stereo camera system. Optically observe fish behavior inside nighttime trawls using cameras and lights mounted inside the net."
